# FootballLeagueTable
My own Football standings table for the Premier League where I fill it from all the fixtures mixing Python and Excel

Last year I created a Spreadsheet to follow up the Premier League season, so I design a few sheets for the purpose, one for the standings where I will collect the data from the fixtures along the season.
Another sheet will have the standings sorted by the points and goal average.
I included one more with all the fixtures in order to use this data with formulas to fill up the standings table.

Week after week I typed the results manually, and this year, for the upcoming season I decided to automatize some things, so some parts previously done with Excel, I will do them with Python instead.
I am currently implementing these upgrades in order to have all set and ready for the opening day of the 23/24 season.

I will attach the last year excel file in case someone is interested on the process, the file has some sheets with raw data and tests I´ve been doing along the year, sorry if it´s a mess.
The next couple wweks I will update the repository with the Python addings.
